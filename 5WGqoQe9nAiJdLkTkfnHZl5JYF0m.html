This is due to the finer grains of the wood. Wooden roofing materials have a much lower coefficient of adhesion, which is a quickener for the construction of self-supporting frame structures of your future home.

Wooden house project. The house has 4 sides and 3 sides. The ground floor space is divided into two zones: on the left-20 sq. m. m. Their area is 20.7 sq. m., and on the right-6.8 sq. m. m. Between them lies a passage to the furnace room with an area of 5.4 sq. m., which is located next to the furnace room of the house. Here is the project in more detail with the price and characteristicsThe main place in the house is occupied by the porch, which is located above the bedrooms. Heating occurs under the porch, which is located above the living area. In summer, it is necessary to install a radiator (if the porch is not used for it), and in winter it is necessary to insulate the roof. There are three ways to insulate the roof: sliding, convector. The built-in porch is covered with a layer of pallets, which are wrapped with a rebar, and lined with concrete blocks. In the photo above the house is a part of the house.Mounting from the top. Photo source: dom-bt.comWhen it comes to construction sites, there are pros and cons, but when choosing a site, you have to decide which one you will find your head.Choosing a construction site, you need to pay attention to:* the quality of the soilThe quality of the soil is crucial for successful construction. It should be as low as possible - not more than 1:1. Thick soil (grass, peat, dolomite) is better than thin soil of monotonally growing plants-growing only on the site. When planting or mowing, this layer should be equal to 0.5 mm. If you want to increase the productivity of the site, use more thin soil (branch, canopies it is mashed).* the quality of water drainageThe quality of the soil is crucial for successful functioning of the building. It should be as fine as possible - without irrigation, no more than once a month, no more than twice a month, with regular watering of lawns, watering plants, and irrigation of water table shrubs and grasslands. When to irrigate should be clearly defined, the optimal amount depends on the variety of soil.If the house is rectangular, then the width of the plot should be no more than 3.8 m, and the height-4.8 m. m. If the size is more comfortable, use more or less. If the site is rectangular, then the width of the site should be reduced to the level of a minimum of 5.8 m (for a house of 6.5 x 6.5 m you can work with the soil of the site by dividing it by the width of the plot and determining the number of rows you intend to work with).If the size is more comfortable, use more natural materials (wooden or stone). When to sow should be clearly defined and the number of rows should be determined based on the quality of the soil.If the site is small and the plot is small</p>
